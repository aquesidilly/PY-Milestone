Testing
Manual Testing:

Interesting Bugs/Problems:

The hashed passwords were not being accepted by Flask-Bcrypt as I had limited the number of characters in the password field on the database to only 30. This meant that the stored values were a substring of the actual hashed password and thus would not be accepted by the hashing algorithm.
Jquery's onclick function would not work for dynamically loaded buttons, therefore I had to switch the Jquery to be an on function instead.
To make all of the recipes in the recipe list be of the same height. The number of categories displayed for each recipe could not be more than 5. So if the number of categories for a particular recipe was above 5, the app would randomly choose 5 to display. This however does not limit the search functionality.
The custom selectpicker were not appearing when they were added dynamically, therefore i added a selectpicker refresh function to run each time they were added.
