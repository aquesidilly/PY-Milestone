The Strategy Plane
Although many events are advertised on social media, it can be difficult to keep track and keep record of them as there is no single 'one page fits all'. As a biker himself, my client has requested this website for not only his own personal use but for the local biking community to have easily accessible information in one place.

This website was created for client Gareth G as a 'One Stop Shop' for event loving bikers. The aim is to provide users with a simple website that allows them to quickly find or create Motorbike Events that can be shared with other motorcycle enthusiasts. All historical events should be recorded, although they do not have to be displayed as this data will not be needed until phase two enhancements of the website.

Site Goals
To increase the number of participants in Motorbike events by providing a simple, easy to use website that contains all the details of upcoming events.
Increase funds raised for charity by the Site owners personal motorcycle club through advertising their events on the website.
User stories
As a user, I want the main purpose of the site to be clear so that I immediately know what the site is intended for upon entering.
As a user, I want to easily navigate the site so that I can find content quickly with ease.
As a user, I want the website to be responsive so that I can clearly view the webpages from my mobile, tablet or desktop.
As a user, I want to be able to register to the website so that I can create and manage my own events.
As a user, I want to be able to search or filter events based on custom criteria so that I can find events suited to me.
As a user, I want a way to contact the site owner so that I can have any questions I may have in regards to the website answered.
As a user, I want to be able to return to the main site without having to use the browser buttons so that I can easily return to the website if I navigate to a page that doesn't exist.

Importance and Difficulty

The Structure Plane
User Story:

As a user, I want the main purpose of the site to be clear so that I immediately know what the site is intended for upon entering.

Acceptance Criteria:

Site Logo to be displayed on the main navigation bar on all pages.
Home Page to display Website Title and information to the user on the purpose of the site.
Implementation:

A site logo will be displayed on the main navigation menu. This should be displayed on all webpages.

The Website title will be displated as a h1 element on the home page and a detailed description of the site will be displayed on the Home page so that is evident of the websites purpose as soon as the user visits the site.

User Story:

As a user, I want to easily navigate the site so that I can find content quickly with ease.

Acceptance Criteria:

Navigation menu to be displayed on all pages.
All navigation links redirect to the correct pages.
Implementation:

A navigation menu will be displayed on all webpages. This will redirect users to the approriate page when clicked. On smaller devices, the menu will collapse into a hamburger menu to make efficient use to screen space. When clicked, the menu will expand out from the right side of the screen displaying all nav items.

The following navigation items will be implemented:

Home - index.html
Sign Up - register.html
Sign In - login.html
Profile - profile.html
Events - events.html
Create Event - create-event.html
Contact - contact.html
Sign Out - (redirects to home page)
User Story:

As a user, I want the website to be responsive so that I can clearly view the webpages from my mobile, tablet or desktop.

Acceptance Criteria:

Content should be responsive and display clearly on all devices with no horizontal scroll.
Implementation:

Materialize will be used for website layout with suitable column sizes and containers to ensure that all content is displayed clearly on all devices with no horizonal scroll. Images will be responsive and scale to fit screen sizes with no stretch or distortion to ensure clear images are displayed to the user.

User Story:

As a user, I want to be able to register to the website so that I can create and manage my own events.

Acceptance Criteria:

Sign up - Login and Logout functionality to be added.
User must have the ability to create, update and delete their own events.
User must have a profile page displaying their basic details and events they have created.
Only the creator of the events should have the ability to update or delete the events.
Implementation:

A Sign Up page will be implemented that allows users to register for an account on the website. The username and password along with basic details for the users account will be stored in a MongoDB database collection called users. In order to create or modify events, a user will have to register and login to the website. Only the creator of the event will have the ability to update or delete the event, this is to prevent unwanted modification or deletion of events by other users. A flash message will be shown to the user to alert them whether the update or delete on their event was successful or failed.

A Sign In page will be implemented to allow registered users the ability to login in to their account.

Once a user has successfully logged in, they will be redirected to their profile page. The users basic details will be displayed on their profile, along with any events they have created. The user will be able to update or delete their events from the profile page. This page will only be available to logged in users, this includes the visibility of the navigation menu item.

A Sign Out button will be displayed to users who are logged in. When clicked this will sign the user out of the website and redirect them to the home page.

A Create Event page will be implemented that will be acessible and visible on the navigation menu to logged in users. The user will be able to create an event from this page. The event information will be stored in a MongoDB database collection called events and the event categories will be stored in a MongoDB collection called categories.

User Story:

As a user, I want to be able to search or filter events based on custom criteria so that I can find events suited to me.

Acceptance Criteria:

Events must be displayed to all users regardless of being logged in.
Users should be able to search for events by Date, Location or Event Type.
Implementation:

An Events page will be implemented that is displayed to all users that is accessible to logged in or guests. This page will display the next six motorbike events from today's date on a materialize collapsible element. In order to make use of space, these events will be collapsable and can be expanded to view details on click.

A search box will be displayed on screen which will allow users to search for events based on Date, Event Type or Location. This will return a filtered, full list events for the current search criteria. This will be implemented by using a database index that will be created on the MongoDB collection events.

User Story:

As a user, I want a way to contact the site owner so that I can have any questions I may have in regards to the website answered and receive feedback to alert on status of form submission.

Acceptance Criteria:

Contact page should be added with a contact form. This form should only submit with valid data input.
Contact form should not submit with invalid data input.
User should be alerted of success/failure status of form submission.
Implementation:

A contact page will be added that contains a materialize form, this will allow users to contact the site owner. The EmailJS API will be used in order to implement this feature and a flash message will be displayed to alert the user if the contact form submitted successfully or unsuccessfully.

Validation will be performed on the form to ensure valid data input. The form will not submit if any field is blank.

Form Fields:

Name - Type: Text, required.
Email - Type: Email, required.
Comments - Type: TextArea, required.
User Story:

As a user, I want to be able to return to the main site without having to use the browser buttons so that I can easily return to the website if I navigate to a page that doesn't exist.

Acceptance Criteria:

If a user redirects to the wrong page, an error will display that contains a link to go back to the main website.
Implementation:

A custom 404 page will be created so that if a user attempts to nagiate to a page that it not found, an error will be displayed. This page will contain a clickable anchor link to allow the user to redirect to the main website without needing to use the browser navigation buttons.

Security
Database connection details are set up in an env.py for development, for security reasons this is not uploaded to GitHub so that database and connection details are not visible to users. In production these are stored in Heroku.

The Surface Plane
Design
Colour Scheme
The main background colour is a cream #d2d2af for the header, footer and form button backgrounds.

The main website text is black #000000

All custom heading text is a deep shade of red #831717

Typography
The main heading on all pages and in the expanded materialize collapsible element headings use the 'PT Serif' font while the rest of the websites content uses the 'Play' font.

Imagery
A background image will be used on all pages displaying a map of Ireland, this image was taken from mapswire.

The website logo was created using online software from the website Canva.

The home page image of the bride and motorbike burnouts is property of Debbie Harkin. - Permission was granted to use the image.

The second home page image of the three biker meet is property of Connor Meehan. - Permission to use this was given.

Differences to Design
After meeting with the client, Gareth G half way through the project, some of the Design was changed as it did not meet expectations. The colour scheme for the Website and fonts were changed as per the clients request.

In the original wireframes the Logo was centered and nav items split to the left and right side. This design did not look well on the page, it left too much white space, nav items were too spaced on extra large screens and upon reading about UX Design standards or navigations, it did not really confirm to norms or user friendly design. The design was then changed to have a banner with a large logo across the top of the page, with the navigation items sat underneath.

Original design and wireframes had the drop down input used to search events as a dual box that could search by either location or event_type. This proved difficult to implement and was agreed upon with the client to add an additional date picker search field.
Search fields were also changed to be single column fields. The reasoning for this was reading this article on form best practices.

Changes in design from the original wireframes can be found in the Skeleton Wireframes section as both final and original wireframes are linked.

Additional verification was addd to the event deletion button to take user confirmation they want to delete the event. This was added so the user doesn't accidentally delete an event and was implemented using a modal with the option to cancel or delete.

500 Error page was not included in the original design but was implemented with the same page layout as the 404 page to account for any internal server errors.

# Deployment
 * Project Creation
To create this project I used the CI Gitpod Full Template by navigating here and clicking the 'Use this template' button.

I was then directed to the create new repository from template page and entered in my desired repo name, then clicked Create repository from template button.

Once created, I navigated to my new repository on GitHub and clicked the Gitpod button which built my workspace.

The following commands were used for version control throughout the project:

 - git add filename - This command was used to add files to the staging area before committing.

 - git commit -m "commit message explaining the updates" - This command was used to to commit changes to the local repository.

 - git push - This command is used to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository.
